## Hi, I am Cyntia 👋😊

I am a fresh graduate of biomedical engineering 👩‍🎓 at Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, and starting to look for roles in working experiences 👩‍🏭.
I’m highly motivated and hardworking individual, interested to meet the new people in order to gain experience and knowledge.
My study in Biomedical Engineering ITS is focused on rehabilitation 🤾‍♀️ and assistive technology ⚙.
I have developed a variety of competencies during college in the academic field, organizational, and events.<br/><br/>
Being a fresher, I think I am very flexible and adaptive to learning new things🏫. I am sure I will be able to contribute something capable to the growth of the company. I am able to work well both in a team environment  as well as using own initiative.
